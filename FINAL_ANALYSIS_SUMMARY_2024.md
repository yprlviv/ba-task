## üö´ Critical API Limitations (2024)

### 1. Rate Limiting Constraints

**Facebook Marketing API Rate Limits (Standard Tier)**:
- **Maximum Points**: 9,000 per 300-second window
- **Point Values**: 
  - Read operations (GET): 1 point
  - Write operations (POST/PUT/DELETE): 3 points
- **Throttling**: 60-second block when exceeded
- **Reset**: Rolling 300-second window

**Impact on Partner API**:
```python
# Example rate limit calculation
campaign_creations_per_5min = 9000 / 3 = 3000 campaigns
campaign_reads_per_5min = 9000 / 1 = 9000 campaigns
mixed_operations = (2000 * 3) + (3000 * 1) = 9000 points
```

**Required Mitigation**:
- Intelligent request queuing
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Rate limit monitoring and alerting
- User feedback during throttling

### 2. Permission and Access Requirements

**Required Facebook Permissions**:
- `ads_management` - Create, edit, delete campaigns
- `ads_read` - Read campaign data and insights  
- `business_management` - Access business-level data

**App Review Requirements**:
- **Development Tier**: 25 ad accounts maximum
- **Standard Tier**: 1,000 ad accounts maximum  
- **Advanced Tier**: Unlimited (requires Facebook app review)

**Review Process Timeline**:
- Application submission: 1-2 weeks preparation
- Facebook review: 2-4 weeks processing
- Approval/rejection: Additional 1-2 weeks for revisions

### 3. Data Access and Technical Constraints

**Campaign Parameter Limitations**:
```yaml
Campaign Name: 
  max_length: 400 characters
  restrictions: No special characters in some regions

Budget Constraints:
  daily_budget_minimum: $1.00 USD (varies by currency)
  lifetime_budget_minimum: 2x daily minimum

  regional_variations: Some objectives limited by geography
```

**Ad Account Constraints**:
```yaml
Creation Method: Manual Business Manager setup only
Verification Required: Business verification (2-5 business days)
Geographic Restrictions: Some regions require additional documentation
