## 🔍 Key Analysis Findings

### Requirements Implementation Status

| Requirement | Status | Implementation Notes |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Campaign Creation | ✅ **Fully Implementable** | All parameters supported via Facebook Marketing API |
| Campaign Editing | ✅ **Fully Implementable** | Complete update capabilities (except objective) |
| Campaign Verification | ✅ **Fully Implementable** | Real-time sync status checking |
| Campaign Deletion | ✅ **Fully Implementable** | Safe deletion with status management |
| Campaign Time Zone | ⚠️ **Partially Implementable** | Managed at ad account level (Facebook limitation) |
| Frequency Capping | ⚠️ **Partially Implementable** | Implemented at ad set level with workaround |
| Advertiser Auto-Creation | ❌ **Not Implementable** | Facebook doesn't allow programmatic ad account creation |

### Critical API Limitations Identified

1. **Ad Account Creation Restriction**
   - **Impact**: Cannot automate advertiser creation
   - **Workaround**: Manual setup with automated validation

2. **Rate Limiting Constraints**
   - **Limit**: 9,000 points per 300 seconds (Standard tier)
   - **Solution**: Built-in rate limiting with intelligent queuing

3. **Campaign Structure Limitations**
   - **Time Zone**: Set at ad account level, inherited by campaigns
   - **Frequency Cap**: Only available at ad set level
   - **Objective Immutability**: Cannot change after creation

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Highlights
